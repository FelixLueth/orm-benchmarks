ORM Benchmarks
==============

**Qualification criteria is:**

* Needs to support minimum 2 databases, e.g. sqlite + something-else
* Runs on Python3.6
* Actively developed
* Has ability to generate initial DDL off specified models
* Handle one-to-many relationships


Benchmarks:
===========

These benchmarks are not meant to be used as a direct comparison.
They suffer from co-operative back-off, and is a lot simpler than common real-world scenarios.

1) Single table
---------------

.. code::

    model Journal:
        timestamp: datetime → now()
        level: int(enum) → 10/20/30/40/50
        text: varchar(255) → A selection of text

A. Insert rows (naïve implementation)
B. Insert rows (transactioned)
C. Inster rows (batch)
D. Filter on level
E. Search in text
F. Aggregation
G. Cursor efficiency


2) Relational
-------------
TODO



ORMs:
=====

Django:
        https://www.djangoproject.com/

peewee:
        https://github.com/coleifer/peewee

Pony ORM:
        https://github.com/ponyorm/pony

        * Does not support bulk insert.

SQLAlchemy ORM:
        http://www.sqlalchemy.org/

SQLObject:
        https://github.com/sqlobject/sqlobject

        * Does not support 16-bit integer for ``level``, used 32-bit instead.
        * Does not support bulk insert.

Tortoise ORM:
        https://github.com/tortoise/tortoise-orm

        * Currently the only ``async`` ORM as part of this suite.
        * Does not support bulk insert.

Perf issues identified
----------------------
* No bulk insert operations
* ``aiosqlite`` runs sqlite in a separate thread, so has thread syncronisation costs. It is vastly better from version 0.6.0, but evidently still there.
* Transactioned inserts appear to be much slower than expected, at about an order of magnitude behind Pony ORM.
* ``pypika`` calls deepcopy too agressively in ``pypika/utils.py:44``
* ``tortoise.models.__init__`` → investigate

On ``pypika`` deepcopy use
--------------------------

Replacing the deepcopy() in _copy with a copy() results in::

  Tortoise ORM, A: Rows/sec:    1252.81
  Tortoise ORM, B: Rows/sec:    4339.90

Which is a significant speedup (28% and 83%). Which makes one think, why is deepcopy() used? Is our own query builder class suceptible to the same reference-instead-of-copy that Python monoids often are? Is there a way to avoid the common case of using pypika for saving/inserting?
I think to answer these questions, we need to have tests for checking modification of the monoid, and our suceptibility thereof. And an investigation re the common case of module saving.
