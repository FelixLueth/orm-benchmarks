ORM Benchmarks
==============

**Qualification criteria is:**

* Needs to support minimum 2 databases, e.g. sqlite + something-else
* Runs on Python3.6
* Actively developed
* Has ability to generate initial DDL off specified models
* Handle one-to-many relationships


Benchmarks:
===========

These benchmarks are not meant to be used as a direct comparison.
They suffer from co-operative back-off, and is a lot simpler than common real-world scenarios.

1) Single table
---------------

.. code::

    model Journal:
        timestamp: datetime → now()
        level: int(enum) → 10/20/30/40/50
        text: varchar(255) → A selection of text

A. Insert rows (naïve implementation)
B. Insert rows (transactioned)
C. Inster rows (batch)
D. Filter on level
E. Search in text
F. Aggregation
G. Cursor efficiency


2) Relational
-------------
TODO



ORMs:
=====

Django:
        https://www.djangoproject.com/

peewee:
        https://github.com/coleifer/peewee

Pony ORM:
        https://github.com/ponyorm/pony

        * Does not support bulk insert.

SQLAlchemy ORM:
        http://www.sqlalchemy.org/

SQLObject:
        https://github.com/sqlobject/sqlobject

        * Does not support 16-bit integer for ``level``, used 32-bit instead.
        * Does not support bulk insert.

Tortoise ORM:
        https://github.com/tortoise/tortoise-orm

        * Currently the only ``async`` ORM as part of this suite.
        * Does not support bulk insert.

Performance of Tortoise
=======================

Interesting Profiling results
-----------------------------

**test_d**:
    ====== ============== =======================================
    Time % function       At
    ====== ============== =======================================
    92.06% execute_select tortoise/backends/sqlite/executor.py:18
    81.27% __init__       tortoise/models.py:329
    7.48%  execute_query  tortoise/backends/sqlite/client:54
    ====== ============== =======================================

Perf issues identified
----------------------
* No bulk insert operations
* Transactioned inserts appear to be much slower than expected, at about an order of magnitude behind Pony ORM.
* ``pypika`` calls deepcopy too agressively in ``pypika/utils.py:44``
* ``tortoise.models.__init__`` → investigate

On ``pypika`` cpu utilisation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Now that ``pypika`` has implemented a perf fix for deepcopy, we still want to see if we can avoid using it.

Adding a very naïve SQL cache results in::

  Tortoise ORM, A: Rows/sec:    1696.85
  Tortoise ORM, B: Rows/sec:    5703.24

Which is a significant speedup. Also there is a lot on unnesseccary work being done, in ``_prepare_insert_values()`` and ``_prepare_insert_columns()`` that can be cached as well, etc..
This will require letting SQL driver do the escaping for us (which would be preferred, as it would allow their own optimisations to happen). This would require a large restructure.
We would have to do a very similar change to allow bulk inserts to work.

On ``tortoise.models.__init__``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The ``__init__`` is very generic, and could benefit from some re-ordering. (and even code-generation)
By doing a quick & dirty change to it I managed to get a 50-54% speedup in ``test_d`` & ``test_e``::

  Tortoise ORM, D: Rows/sec:  170751.78
  Tortoise ORM, E: Rows/sec:  167254.27
